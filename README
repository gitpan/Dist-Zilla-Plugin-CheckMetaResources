NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::CheckMetaResources - Ensure META includes resources

VERSION
    version 0.001

SYNOPSIS
      # in dist.ini

      [CheckMetaResources]

DESCRIPTION
    This is a "before release" Dist::Zilla plugin that ensures that your
    META file will contain some "resources" data.

    By default, it requires you to have at least 'repository' and
    'bugtracker' sections, but 'homepage' is optional.

    You can toggle any of these checks on or off. For example:

      [CheckMetaResources]
      repository = 1
      bugtracker = 0
      homepage = 1
